# The Elementary MBA Text Game
##The game was created while taking the Udemy online course on creating games using Unity.
#####In the game you make choices that lead to the success or failure of your delicous frozen treats business.
#####The idea for the game came from the economics and financial literacy program that I teach at Hirsch Academy TeamCFA.
#####I hope to expand the program. Ideally it would be Khan Academy for economics and financial literacy.
#####The game is written in C\##
